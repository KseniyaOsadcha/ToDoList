# ToDo List

This ToDo is written in JavaScript library React.

It can add, delete, mark as done and edit your tasks for today (as well as many interesting features like sorting etc).

In the future I want to add the ability to register and even turn it into a calendar.

You can see it by following the link: https://kseniyaosadcha.github.io/ToDoList/

Thank you for attention!
And have a nice day!)
